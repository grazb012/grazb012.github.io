			D Tier
		</h1>
		<h2 class="text subheader">
			The D tier is where we start to get into gross territory. These are cereals that I do not ever want to eat, and I will actively turn it down if offered to me. They are at best not good and at worst very gross. Don't give me a bowl of any of these cereals.

				Trix
			</h3>

			<p class="text caption">
				Trix are for kids, and I am not a kid anymore. Fruity cereals are never great, and Trix is one of the worst. It has a really weird chemical flavor and the puffs aren't as good of a texture as Cocoa Puffs, which is just disappointing. Please do not ever give me Trix.

				Apple Jacks
			</h3>

			<p class="text caption">
				I have a lot of friends who really like Apple Jacks, and I question their judgment immensely. Apple Jacks have basically no flavor, just the tiniest hint of fake cinnamon, and the texture is so similar to styrofoam I can't stand it. In milk it's even worse, and it basically just starts turning into mush immediately. I don't want it.

				Froot Loops
			</h3>
			<img src="../photos/froot-loops.jpeg">
			<p class="text caption">
				Froot Loops basically take all the issues I have with Trix and Apple Jacks and combine them into one cereal. The gross fruity flavor plus the gross foamy texture make a bad cereal. It has more flavor than Apple Jacks and less than Trix, which kind of makes it better and worse than both other options. In the end, it's just not very good.

			<h3 class="text name">
				Pops
			</h3>
			<img src="../photos/pops.jpeg">
			<p class="text caption">
				Pops are probably the least offensive in this tier. They have a better flavor and texture than the others, but something about the vibe of this cereal is just off. Every time I remember eating it as a kid I felt slightly nauseous? Not sure why, but it's staying in D tier.
