			B Tier
		</h1>
		<h2 class="text subheader">
			The B tier is pretty good. These are well loved cereals that I appreciate for doing what they do. I would be happy to eat a bowl if I was handed one of any of these, but they are not my first choice of cereal. I've got to be in a specific mood to want these ones.

				Cinnamon Toast Crunch

				Controversial opinion: Cinnamon Toast Crunch is overrated. I know there's a big fanbase for this cereal out there, but it has never been my favorite. I think it has a great flavor and texture at first, but when it goes into milk it has a very distinct floppy cardboard vibe, and I'm not into that. I would eat it, but not if there were other options around. It's only in B tier because I know I would face extreme slander from its loyal supporters.

				Rice Krispies

				Rice Krispies are good. Point blank period. The flavor and texture are both there, not to mention the versatility! Homemade rice krispie treats are some of the most delicious things ever. It is good in milk, but it gets soggy fast, but the real time it shines is without milk, when you can really hear the Snap Crackle Pop! Cocoa Krispies are also good.

				Cocoa Puffs

				Cocoa Puffs are my favorite of the chocolate cereals, but I don't love chocolate cereals. It has a nice puffy (duh) texture and the chocolate coating doesn't taste too much like chemicals. The puffs stand up really well to milk, and the best part? The milk slowly turns into chocolate milk, giving you an extra treat at the end of your cereal eating session. I'm not cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, but I do like them.

				Fruity Pebbles

				Fruity Pebbles are just fun. They have a great color, and the texture and flavor aren't too bad. It's hard to make a "fruity" cereal that isn't super gross and chemical tasting, but this one does okay even with a slight chemical taste. The small size of the flakes is also really nice, and it's not too overwhelming, I appreciate them.
