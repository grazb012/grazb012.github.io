			A Tier
		</h1>
		<h2 class="text subheader">
			The A tier is still very good. These are solid cereals that I enjoy, reliable choices that I can count on if I just want a nice bowl of cereal. These are pretty plain, nothing crazy special but nothing at all wrong with either. I would feel comfortable keeping them in my kitchen cabinet for myself or for anyone in my house who wants some cereal.

				Rice Chex

				Chex, particularly Rice Chex, is a solid choice of cereal. They are crunchy yet light, not too sweet, and can be enjoyed plain or with the addition of things like banana slices, which I love in my cereal. It doesn't get too soggy too quickly and it still has a nice flavor by itself. This is my favorite cereal to reach my hand into the box and eat dry fistfuls of when I'm having a bit of a breakdown.

				Special K Red Berries

				Plain Special K is good, but I didn't include it on the list because of its far superior sister, Special K Red Berries. You have the classic crunchy flakes combined with freeze-dried strawberries. Freeze-dried strawberries are delicious on their own, a perfect balance of tart and sweet. Add that to a crunchy bowl of cereal and we have a winner. It gives the illusion of health and adds a bit of color to the day. Milk improves the experience, making the strawberries and the cereal softer in a good way, but the flakes do sometimes get too soggy if left for too long.
