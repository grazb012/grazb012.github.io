			The F tier is the worst of the worst. These cereals are actually disgusting and do not deserve to be eaten by anyone. Stop fooling yourselves! These are terrible.

				<p class="text caption">
					Take two of the world's grossest foods and combine them into a cereal and you get Raisin Bran. The name alone is one of the most appalling things I've ever heard. I am a raisin hater, and the bran flakes do absolutely nothing to help. You have to be 70+ years old or truly insane to eat this. Whose idea was this? I hate them.

				Reese's Puffs

				<p class="text caption">
					Peanut butter, chocolate, great when separate but when they combine they make the morning time epic. NO. Reese's Puffs are straight up nasty. I love chocolate and peanut butter, and I love the song from the commerical, but these are absolutely not it. There's a weird powdery coating on the puffs and they just don't taste good at all. Every time I have tried to like these I immediately just want to spit them out. I'm sorry, they are gross.

					I love Cap'n Crunch, but Crunch Berries are G R O S S. They took something great, perfect even, and added the most disgusting thing they could think of. The combination of flavors is so nasty and I am not here for it. No thank you.

				Wheaties

				<p class="text caption">
					Does anyone actually like these? I don't think anyone does. If you want to be healthy just don't eat cereal for breakfast, stop trying to force fake health onto us. Wheaties are so bland and the texture also sucks, and they get soggy in 0.2 seconds. I have never been able to finish more than half a bowl of these.

				Kix

				<p class="text caption">
					I have a personal vendetta against Kix. When I was about 8 or 9 my parents decided they wanted to be healthy and Kix was the only cereal my dad would buy for like a year. It is the cereal parents buy when they want to pretend to be healthy. The texture is so bad and it gets soggy immediately. It takes away all the joy of cereal, and every time I ate it I wanted to vom.

				<p class="text caption">
					Tasting Krave was one of my life's biggest disappointments. I thought it was gonna be a delicious cereal with some real chocolate inside, but it was just gross. The chocolate tasted fake and chemical-y and the cereal pieces had a bad, weirdly rough texture and bad taste as well. Overall sad.

					Take away the sugar from Frosted Flakes and you get sad, sad Corn Flakes. They just aren't very good and milk makes it way worse. No me gusta.
