			Alice's Thoughts of the Day
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have been having the most curious dreams lately, but when I wake up I can’t seem to remember what has happened in them! All I can recall is a silly white rabbit carrying a pocketwatch and yelling, “I’m late!” I don’t remember what happens after that, but I always get this feeling that I should follow him...
			<br> <br>
			My sister and I plan to go on a walk today since it’s so lovely outside. We’ll probably sit by the riverbank and do some reading as we usually do. I hope I don’t fall asleep again, she always gets upset with me when I do. I just can’t help it!
