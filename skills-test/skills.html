					I don't do much to archive my photos, I just let them upload to my iCloud once taken on my phone, and the Photos application automatically categorizes them into Places and Months, which I can easily access when I'm looking for a specific photo or video.

					My most important files are probably all of my school documents. I download the necessary docs I need for each of my classes, such as my syllabi, any readings, and digital resources. Each class gets a folder on my desktop during the semester, and there are separate subfolders in each one per project, as well as folders that organize extra assets for each project. Folders are really important to stay organized, especially with coding as it's easier to make relative paths when things are in the right place. I also upload many of my projects to google drive where it is saved to the cloud, so I have backups online instead of just locally.
