				Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="answers">
				 a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="text">
				And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by <a href="../four/index.html" class="begin">trial</a> and <a href="../../index.html" class="end">error.</a>

				I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.
